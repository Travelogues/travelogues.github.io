The conference reflects upon the highly topical question of perceptions of 'otherness' and focuses on (Early) Modern
Travelogues on the 'Orient'. The 'Orient' (especially the Ottoman and Persian Empires) was a popular travel destination
during this period. People went there on pilgrimages, diplomatic missions, and to trade, conduct research or educate
themselves. Records of these experiences offer an excellent source to scrutinize perceptions of otherness. By analyzing
this, one has to face several challenges: what people perceived as 'other' is always an expression of relationships. It
varied individually and in connection with the socio-cultural background of each person. There is no binary distinction
between 'other' and 'own', but a transition zone with a multiverse of variations. Additionally, most of the travelogues
were (co-)dependent upon each other and/or different kinds of media. What was perceived as 'other' created and
solidified power relationships as well as stereotypes. Current research has emphasized the mutual influence of
perceptions of otherness and transformation processes connected to politics, media and society. Again, a strong
influence of the socio-cultural background can be observed. In the German-speaking-world, the conquest of Constantinople
(1453) and the failed siege of Vienna (1683) were decisive events, while the conquest of Granada (1492) played an important
role in Spain, and the Battle of Mohács (1526) and the Peace of Eisenburg (1664) had a lasting influence in Hungary.
From the 18th century onward, the increasingly differientiated and critically considered notion of 'Orientalism'
(Edward W. Said) as well as a simultaneously prospering 'Orientmania' seem to be tangible on a more transcultural level.

The projects '[Travelogues: Perceptions of the Other 1500–1876 – A Computerized Analysis](http://www.travelogues-project.info/)' (FWF-project: I 3795-G28) and
'[The Mediality of Diplomatic Communication. Habsburg Envoys in Constantinople in theMid-17th Century](http://diploko.at/en/)' (FWF-project: P30091,
University of Salzburg) invite you to discuss perceptions 'otherness' in travelogues on the 'Orient' from the 16th to
the 19th centuries. The international and interdisciplinary conference will explore possibilities and limits of
comparative analysis and pose the questions of how perceptions of otherness were shaped and what this tells us today
about the solidification and change of powerrelationships, stereotypes and prejudices.
