The ‘Orient‘ was a popular travel destination during the (Early) Modern Period. People went there on pilgrimages, 
diplomatic missions, and to trade, conduct research or educate themselves. Records of these experiences offer an 
excellent source to scrutinize perceptions of otherness. By analyzing this, one has to face several challenges: what 
people perceived as ‘other‘ is always an expression of relationships. It varied individually and in connection with 
the socio-cultural background of each person. There is no binary distinction between ‘other‘ and ‘own‘, but a transition
zone with a multiverse of variations. Additionally, most of the travelogues were (co-)dependent upon each other and/or 
different kinds of media. What was perceived as 'other' created and solidified power relationships as well as stereotypes.
Current research has emphasized the mutual influence of perceptions of otherness and transformation processes connected 
to politics, media and society. Again, a strong influence of the socio-cultural background can be observed. In the 
German-speaking-world, the conquest of Constantinople (1453) and the failed siege of Vienna (1683) were decisive events, 
while the conquest of Granada (1492) played an important role in Spain, and the Battle of Mohács (1526) and the Peace of 
Eisenburg (1664) had a lasting influence in Hungary. From the 18th century onward, the increasingly differientiated and 
critically considered notion of ‘Orientalism‘ (Edward W. Said) as well as a simultaneously prospering ‘Orientmania‘ seem 
to be tangible on a more transcutlural level.

These source and topic-inherent circumstances make comparative analysis more challenging, reflected, for example, in the 
fact that previous research on ‘otherness‘ usually focused on individual or a few selected travelogues or similar media 
(types). Therefore, possibilities and limits of comparative studies will be explored in the course of the workshop. To 
enhance the discussion, a focus in terms of geography, types of media and time is established. We invite you to discuss 
perceptions of the ‘Orient‘ (especially the Ottoman and Persian Empires) in travelogues from the 16th to the 19th 
centuries. To obtain a comprehensive understanding, the travellers will originate in as many as possible different 
cultures. Among others, non-European perspectives are particularly welcome, especially on travels within the Orient. 
The papers of the workshop will cover, but are not limited to, the following topics.

**Topic 1 Perceptions of Otherness:** What was perceived as ‘other‘ in the travelogues on the ‘Orient‘? How was otherness 
constructed? Which differences and developments can be shown in a synchronous or diachronic perspective?

**Topic 2 Biographics:** To what extent did the biographical and socio-cultural background of the persons involved in the 
production of travelogues and the (presumed) recipients influence the perceptions of otherness contained therein? How 
can this be proven?

**Topic 3 Intermateriality and Intermodality:** How did the travelogues relate to other reports and media, especially 
concerning the texts and pictures. How can this be traced?

**Topic 4 Possibilites of comparative analysis:** Is it possible to translate the otherness constructed in travelogues into 
comparable categories? What are the challenges, and which (new) possibilities do digital analysis methods offer?

**Topic 5 Impact:** How can we track the contemporary reception and subsequent significance of (individual) travel reports, 
aside from the number of their editions and translations?

The workshop takes place within the framework the FWF/DFG project "Travelogues: Perceptions of the Other 1500–1876—A 
Computerized Analysis". An interdisciplinary approach is intended. The call is addressed to all researchers, regardless 
of research discipline. A peer-reviewed publication of the contributions is planned. The presentation languages are 
preferably English or German. Please send a **proposal** of approximately **250 words** and a **short CV** to 
Doris Gruber ([doris.gruber(at)oeaw.ac.at](javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('nbjmup;epsjt/hsvcfsApfbx/bd/bu');)) by **07.01.2019**.
