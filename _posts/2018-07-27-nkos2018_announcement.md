We are happy to announce that our submission titled "Traveling through Space and Time, or: Making Historical Travelogues
Accessible" (Jan RÃ¶rden, Bernhard Haslhofer, Rainer Simon and Sven Schlarb) was accepted to the [NKOS 2018](https://at-web1.comp.glam.ac.uk/pages/research/hypermedia/nkos/nkos2018/programme.html)
workshop. The NKOS (Networked Knowledge Organization Systems) Workshop will be held as part of TPDL 2018 and DCMI 2018.

We will give a general introductory presentation to the project, and then focus on the technical aspects of our work. 
Our presentation will be followed by a short Q&A session. Both the full text of our submission, as well as the presentation
will be published by the workshop, and be linked here once they are available.

We are very much looking forward to present our early work in Porto - see you there!
